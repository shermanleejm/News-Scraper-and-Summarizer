When mobile phone usage comes between employers and domestic workers,"SINGAPORE: Noraini Wahid was going to renew her foreign domestic worker’s contract when she discovered something distressing: The latter had a secret mobile phone, with pornographic photos and videos inside.,Unknown to her, the maid — who had a boyfriend — had also been taking selfies on the bed in her mother’s room “wearing just a bra”, and sharing those photos with him.,Noraini, a mother of three, had earlier put restrictions on the domestic worker having her own phone. But the latter bought one from another maid living in the same block, and hid it from her employer.,“The handphone is the root of all evil,” said Noraini. “I understand that they’re away from home, they miss their families … but you need to show me (that) I can trust you with your phone.”,So, while mobile phones keep many of us connected today, they are driving a wedge between helpers and employers like her. And the programme Talking Point finds out how employers can manage their maids’ smartphone usage to prevent misuse. (,),International Labour Organisation (ILO) statistics last year show that fewer than half (47 per cent) of 297 employers surveyed in Singapore let their domestic workers access their phone outside working hours.,The confiscation of migrant workers’ mobile phones, or restriction on usage, is a “tactic in which employers exert power” over the workers, the ILO said in the report, Mobile Women And Mobile Phones.,The way some maids use their smartphones and overshare information, however, can be worrying.,In video-sharing network TikTok, for example — which is popular among domestic workers right now — it took Talking Point host Diana Ser only five minutes to find 50 accounts created by them.,One showed a maid in a bath towel dancing at her employer’s home. Another video was of a domestic worker singing and dancing with her employer’s daughter. And another one showed the street and block of the employer’s private estate.,“I’m wondering if permission was given by the parents for this video (with the child) to be taken and uploaded,” said Ser.,“Quite a few videos were taken within the premises of the employers. Again I wonder if that’s with the employers’ permission.”,For John Gee, a former president of non-profit organisation Transient Workers Count Too, it would not bother him if his helper were to share videos of herself “dancing around the kitchen, having fun”.,But he draws the line at pictures or videos of his children or even their bedrooms.,“We wouldn’t bring strangers into the bedroom — why would you want your bedroom to be shown online, on social media?” he said. “That’s something that you should definitely (make) very clear shouldn’t happen.”,While some of these videos did not reveal precise locations, technology writer Paul Mah, who covers cybersecurity trends, thinks there is cause for concern.,The images and videos were probably uploaded without the employers’ permission or knowledge, he said. And “over a period of time, (they) reveal a lot of information”, such as the household they are employed in and the people living there.,In fact, from one of the TikTok accounts, Ser was able to track down the domestic worker’s address, down to the Housing and Development Board unit in Tampines and the employer she was caring for.,“Even when the helper moves on to the next household, these videos (and) images presumably will … stay on social media,” said Mah. “And anybody is able to log in and view (them).”,These videos could also attract scammers, who may potentially use them to “find out more information about a household before trying to call (on) the vulnerable and elderly”.,While first-time foreign domestic workers in Singapore must attend a one-day Settling-In Programme to be familiarised with local laws and equipped with on-the-job safety training, there is no module covering the dos and don’ts of using mobile phones at work.,The Manpower Ministry also does not have explicit rules on how employers should manage their helper’s smartphones.,Instead, it is left to the policy of employment agencies and for employers to lay down the house rules, such as when she can use her phone.,Calvin Chew, for example, lets his maid use her phone when she has finished her duties. But to restrict her from overusing it, he does not provide her with Wi-Fi access at home.,“She’d be using (her) own data plan. So the more she uses, the more she pays,” he said. “In that sense, she’ll know how to control (her usage).”,Domestic worker Robina Navato knows many others whose phones were confiscated before they started their jobs, which is why they resort to buying a second, secret phone.,Her previous employer was strict about her phone usage, allowing her to use it only after 11pm. But by then, her family members would be asleep. She began to feel homesick, and called it quits after two months.,She decided to share her story because “it’s very important for employers to know that we domestic workers are human beings too”. “Sometimes they forget that we’re away from our families,” she said.,Over the past 20 years, Gee and his wife Cecilia Siow have employed six helpers in their household, and they have never had to place any restrictions on mobile phone use.,“I’ve never had my boss … talk to me about handphone usage,” pointed out Siow. “I’d be appalled if I have to do that with Lyn (the current helper). She’s not a child.”,But what happens if there are helpers who, despite having guidelines, continue to use the phone when they are not supposed to do so?,Said Gee: “If we (employers) have concerns, then we should share them. We talk about it, and we come to an understanding.”",<200 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/when-mobile-phone-usage-comes-between-employers-domestic-workers-12392704>

"Coronavirus outbreak: Schools, eldercare facilities to suspend large gatherings after first local transmission","SINGAPORE: Schools, pre-schools and eldercare facilities will suspend large gatherings as part of enhanced measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among vulnerable groups, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong on Tuesday (Feb 4).,Businesses and employers have also been urged to implement heightened measures if the need arises. ,The measures were laid out as the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced Singapore's first "","" of the novel coronavirus, which originated in Wuhan, China.,Schools will suspend mass assemblies, stagger recess times, as well as cancel camps and introduce visitor management.,Pre-schools will likewise cease large group and communal activities, excursions and field trips, and increase the frequency of temperature taking.,Co-curricular activities and after-school programmes may continue in smaller groups, said the Ministry of Education (MOE).,""The aim is to circumscribe the intermingling of students by not conducting mass level learning activities. We will be implementing them from this week beginning with immediately with no mass flag raising ceremonies,"" said director of schools at MOE Liew Wei Li.,""We will also be ring-fencing our schools to keep them safe and our students safe by instituting visitor management measures, such as by taking the visitor's temperature before they step into the school.,""And we would also check the travel history, such as if they have recent travel history to mainland China, they will not be allowed into our schools to interact with our students."",Schools are familiar with such measures because they have previously implemented them to manage the spread of diseases such as H1N1 and SARS, said Ms Liew.,Eldercare facilities will also stop outings and large gatherings.,""We are closely monitoring the situation, and will calibrate our posture accordingly as new developments arise,"" said MOH, adding that existing travel restrictions, and quarantine and leave of absence measures will continue to help contain the risk of spread.,But ""despite our best efforts, Singapore could still see extensive community spread"", said Mr Gan.,""At that point, we will need to consider measures to reduce human-to-human interaction, such as cancelling mass gatherings, suspending schools and paring down non-essential services, and introducing further infection-control and monitoring measures to slow the spread."", - including four locally transmitted cases - were announced on Tuesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Singapore to 24.,""Though this cluster constitutes limited local transmission, there is as yet no evidence of widespread sustained community transmission,"" MOH said.,""Singapore has been preparing for such clusters, and our measures implemented thus far have been directed towards preventing and containing the risk of spread beyond such local clusters to the broader community.,""As we have stepped up our surveillance, we expect to see more such local clusters in Singapore, including cases of local transmission."",Mr Gan said his ministry is contacting individuals with profiles similar to the four locally transmitted cases, who have had recent close contact with individuals with travel history to mainland China.,Surveillance efforts have also been expanded to test all individuals with pneumonia at Singapore hospitals for the coronavirus since last week.,Likely modes of transmission, based on current evidence, are mainly through contact with droplets from infected individuals, said MOH, adding that the virus can also transmit through surface contact.,The most effective method to prevent such transmission is through good personal hygiene and social responsibility on the part of those who are unwell, said the ministry.,Employers in Singapore have so far got their staff members to declare their travel history, implemented health monitoring, put employees who recently travelled to China on leave of absence and implemented flexible working arrangements.,""But as the situation evolves, we will step our posture accordingly to further contain transmission in Singapore,"" said Mr Gan.,Businesses and organisations, including food and beverage outlets, retail shops and hotels, are advised to increase frequency of cleaning, said permanent secretary at the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Aubeck Kam.,This applies especially to areas with high traffic or human contact, including counters where customers are served, rooms where visitors are hosted and public areas such as lifts, handrails, pantries, toilets and bin areas.,The measures are outlined in a general advisory written by MOM, Ministry of Trade and Industry, the National Trades Union Congress and Singapore National Employers Federation.,Organisations should follow sanitation and hygiene advisories which have been given by the National Environment Agency (NEA), said the advisory.,Clear guidance should be set for frontline staff members when encountering customers who are unwell, it added. For example, they could advise customers looking unwell to see a doctor, and reschedule appointments or offer other modes of service.,If it is necessary to provide urgent services to sick customers, proper procedures should be observed. For instance, staff members could put on a surgical mask and separate sick customers from other customers. ,Individual workers should wash their hand frequently, cover themselves if they cough or sneeze, and keep their hands away from the face.,Mr Kam also added that on top of these good personal hygiene practices, they should take their own temperature regularly and be mindful of respiratory symptoms.,If they are unwell, they should wear a mask, seek medical attention promptly and stay away from the workplace.,Those with no symptoms and are well need not wear a mask.,The measures are intended to pre-empt the possibility of general community spread, and employers should be vigilant and ready to implement further heightened measures should the situation require it.",<200 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/wuhan-coronavirus-singapore-enhanced-measures-schools-businesses-12389986>
Malaysian collective travel document will not be accepted for entry to Singapore from 2021: ICA,"SINGAPORE: The Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will no longer accept the Malaysian Collective Travel Document (MCTD) for entry into Singapore from Jan 1, 2021.,“This is to strengthen the security and efficiency of immigration clearance at Singapore’s checkpoints,” ICA said in a news release on Wednesday (Feb 5).,The MCTD can be used by groups of five to 20 Malaysian nationals to enter Singapore instead of passports.,“Malaysian travellers currently issued with an MCTD should apply for passports if they plan to travel to Singapore from Jan 1, 2021 onwards,"" said ICA.,Use of the document poses security concerns as it allows multiple unrelated travellers to share one travel document, the authority said, adding that they do not accept any other country’s collective travel documents.,MCTD holders are also unable to use automated lanes.,As the MCTD requires manual data entry of all travellers’ details, it results in longer clearance times and poses “operational concerns” as the ICA moves towards automated and multi-modal biometrics for clearance.,“ICA has informed the Immigration Department of Malaysia of our plans to cease recognition of the MCTD for immigration clearance, and will work with them on the implementation,"" it added.",<200 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-ica-malaysian-collective-travel-document-accept-2021-12394842>

"Tuition teacher repeatedly raped Primary 6 student, gets jail and caning","SINGAPORE: He was hired to give a 12-year-old girl private tuition for her Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE), but instead he was intimate with her during lessons and eventually raped her thrice.,The 43-year-old man, who cannot be named as it will identify the victim, was sentenced to 10 years and 10 months' jail and 12 strokes of the cane on Wednesday (Feb 5) for two counts of statutory rape and another charge of an indecent act with a child.,Another four charges were taken into consideration, including the third rape charge.,The court heard that the victim lived with her parents and younger sister.,In early 2017, when she was in Primary 5, she went for regular mathematics tuition at a tuition centre where the accused held a freelance job.,The man, then 41, gave his number to all his students and encouraged them to call him if they had any problems, and told the victim to confide in him.,They started texting each other, with their conversations becoming increasingly intimate and personal by the end of 2017.,The tutor told the girl that ""he liked her the best, as a student, out of his whole class"". ,In return, she said she considered him her ""soulmate"", and agreed to become his girlfriend in April 2018.,They began dating, going for meals and hanging out at shopping malls, holding hands like a couple, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Asoka Markandu and Eugene Teh.,The girl kept her relationship a secret from her parents, and recommended the man to her parents as a tutor as it was her PSLE year.,Her parents hired the accused to provide one-on-one tuition to their older daughter for Math, Science and English at their home.,He began giving her private tuition classes weekly on Sunday for four hours, from May 2018.,Between May 2018 and September 2018, there were several occasions when the tutor was intimate with the victim during the lessons, said the prosecutors.,During this period, the tutor was cohabiting with his girlfriend and engaging in sexual activities with her.,In late May 2018, shortly after the victim turned 12, the tutor picked the girl up from her school and drove her to a mall in Woodlands.,They entered a toilet for the disabled and kissed and touched each other in what was the victim's first sexually intimate experience with her tutor.,They went to Bukit Panjang Plaza months later on Dec 5, 2018, having arranged to have sex.,The tutor knew that the victim was a virgin, but he went with her into a toilet for the disabled, where he raped her.,He raped her again about a week later at his own home, and a third time that month.,The girl went on holiday to Malaysia with her parents in late December 2018 when they noticed that she was busy sending messages on her phone.,They questioned her and realised that she was contacting her tutor, the court heard.,The girl's mother demanded to look at the messages, but the girl refused. Her father intervened and took the phone from her, and the illicit relationship was revealed.,They forbade her from having any further contact with the accused, and the girl's father filed a police report saying he had found ""sexually suggestive messages between my daughter and her tuition teacher"".,Deputy Public Prosecutor Asoka Markandu asked for a sentence of at least 11 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane.,He said the tutor ""showed no qualms in abusing the trust reposed in him by an exceptionally vulnerable victim and her parents"".,He noted that there was an escalation of sexual intimacy between May 2018 and December 2018, culminating with three counts of statutory rape in the last month.,""The escalation of sexual activities between the accused and the victim strongly suggests that there was an element of sexual grooming involved,"" said Mr Asoka.,""The incidents of sexual intimacy was not limited to a single isolated act and was also committed in the privacy of the victim's home, during tuition class,"" he said.,""Children, such as the victim, are vulnerable and often lack the emotional and intellectual maturity to make important decisions about their lives, including those pertaining to sexual conduct and behaviour."",He said the accused had been engaged by the victim's parents to prepare her for PSLE, but instead abused his position and developed an intimate relationship with her.,""At the material time, the accused was also cohabiting and engaging in sexual activities with his girlfriend,"" he said.,He added that while the victim had developed a liking for the tutor and consented to the sexual acts, the man had ""a responsibility not to take advantage of her naivety or to exploit her for his own sexual gratification"".,""At that tender age, the victim was not in a position to appreciate or understand the implications of a sexual relationship,"" said Mr Asoka.,Defence lawyer Raphael Louis asked instead for nine years and eight months' jail and six strokes of the cane.,He said his client had no previous convictions, pleaded guilty early, and did a good job in his 10 years as a ""caring"" tutor.,This was relevant because of his potential to be rehabilitated, said the lawyer.,""He went the extra mile to help his students academically and emotionally,"" said Mr Louis. ""He would also buy assessment books, (he) was friendly and approachable."",""Unfortunately, because of his friendly demeanour ... he didn't draw proper boundaries with the victim."",The lawyer said ""there is no excuse for what my client has done"", and that ""he deserves to be punished"", but said he had to ensure the punishment was fair and not harsh.,Justice Valerie Thean said she found that there was a ""serious breach of trust"", and noted that the victim was 12.,For each count of statutory rape, the tutor could have been sentenced to up to 20 years and fined or caned.",<200 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tuition-teacher-repeatedly-raped-primary-6-student-gets-jail-and-12394536>
4 locally transmitted cases among new coronavirus patients in Singapore,"SINGAPORE: Singapore confirmed on Tuesday (Feb 4) its first locally transmitted cases of the novel coronavirus, among six new cases of the disease detected in the country.,Four Singapore residents with no recent travel history to China have tested positive for the virus, which has , since it was detected in Wuhan in central China.,One of them was a tour guide for a group of Chinese tourists, two work at a shop the group had visited,,while a fourth case of local transmission was the domestic helper of one of the cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said at a briefing.,The tour group had arrived in Singapore from China on Jan 22 and went to Malaysia from Jan 24 to 26. They re-entered Singapore via Woodlands Checkpoint at 3am on Jan 27 and flew from Changi Airport Terminal 1 at 6am.,Pending confirmation from the Chinese authorities, the travellers are from Guangxi, and at least two of them have since been confirmed to have the coronavirus, said MOH.,""The Ministry of Health has commenced contact tracing to identify individuals who had close contact with these cases, so as to ring-fence the cluster and limit further spread,"" said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.,Another two new cases announced by the authorities on Tuesday are Singapore residents who had been evacuated from Wuhan.,This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 24.,Two of the patients who caught the virus here are salespeople at Yong Thai Hang, a health product store that serves primarily Chinese tourists. They are the 19th and 20th cases reported.,The tour group had visited the store, among other places, on Jan 23.,The 19th case, a 28-year-old Singapore permanent resident, reported developing a sore throat and fever on Jan 29. She went to Tan Tock Seng Hospital emergency department on Jan 30 and was discharged after a chest X-ray found she did not have pneumonia.,She stayed at home from Jan 31 till Sunday before being admitted to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) on Monday.,The 20th case is a 48-year-old Singaporean woman who lives at Hougang Street 61. She reported symptoms on Jan 25 and was admitted on Monday to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID).,Information about her movements between Jan 25 and Monday was not provided.,Case 19's maid, a 44-year-old Indonesian national, is the 21st case. She reported onset of symptoms on Sunday and did not leave her house until she was admitted to SGH the next day.,A tour guide who brought tour groups to Yong Thai Hang is the 24th case. The 32-year-old Singaporean was asymptomatic when she went to NCID. ,The 22nd and 23rd cases, both Singaporeans, were among 92 people evacuated from Wuhan on Jan 30 and the two had no symptoms when they boarded the flight to Singapore. ,They were put under quarantine in Singapore and tested positive on Monday despite showing no symptoms. They are now both in isolation rooms at NCID. ,Authorities on Tuesday said that the four cases of local transmission are not evidence of community spread as they can be traced back to recent travellers from China and some had close contact with one another.,Mr Gan elaborated on the difference between a local transmission cluster and community spread: “The main difference is that for this cluster, we could identify all the sources that were involved. The source was a group of mainland China tourists. We have their names, we have an indication of the patients that fell ill.,“Therefore we could identify the specific source… If we are able to ringfence this particular cluster, we can control the spread. Therefore we say it is a limited local transmission.”,But if there are multiple clusters and the Government cannot determine the source, that is when it would be labelled a widespread community transmission, he added. ,“When that happens, we will move to Dorscon (Dors condition) Orange. Today, we are still at Yellow.”,Currently, Singapore is at Dorscon Yellow, signifying that the virus is severe and can infect from person to person, but is chiefly occurring outside Singapore. The next step up is Dorscon Orange, whereby the virus is spreading in Singapore but not widely, and is being contained. ,At the heart of Singapore’s response plan is the Disease Outbreak Response System (Dors), a crisis management plan which did not exist in 2003, but was drafted after SARS and refined again in the wake of the swine flu (H1N1) pandemic in 2009.,MOH's director of medical services Kenneth Mak added that even though the domestic helper of one of the cases was infected, it was in an ""enclosed setting"" within the home.,""We're still continuing to do contact tracing and we'll continue to be vigilant for more cases. There may be more cases that come out in relation to the same exposure to ... this travel group,"" he added.,Answering queries from reporters, Mr Gan said that the mode of transmission between the tour group and the patients cannot be determined, but the tour guide would have been with the tour group for a long period of time while the salespeople would have interacted with the travellers at the shop.,""It's not transient contact ... where you happen to meet (the person) on the street,"" he said.,Dr Mak said that the tour guide reported that some of the travellers were coughing and sneezing while they were in Singapore but it would be ""speculative"" to say that this was the mode of transmission.,As the tour group has returned to China, some of the contacts are a result of checking with the Chinese authorities, Mr Gan added.,As an added precaution, individuals who, like the cases of local transmission, have had recent close contact with people with travel history to mainland China will be contacted.,Authorities are also , who had tested positive for the novel coronavirus after attending a meeting at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in Singapore that involved Chinese nationals.,In addition, MOH has expanded surveillance efforts to conduct 2019-nCoV testing on all individuals with pneumonia at Singapore hospitals since last week.,Other measures to pre-empt possible community spread of the virus were also announced, including enhanced cleaning of public areas.,Authorities have urged places with high human traffic to step up cleaning, including food and beverage outlets, shops and hotels.,""Current evidence suggests that the likely modes of transmission are mainly through contact with droplets from infected individuals, either directly or indirectly through hands that have come into contact with these droplets,"" said MOH.,""The virus can also transmit through surface contact."",Sanitation and hygiene advisories have been disseminated by the National Environment Agency. ,A more cautious stance will be taken with vulnerable groups like young children and the elderly, authorities said.,Schools will not hold mass assemblies and recess sessions will be staggered, while school camps will be cancelled.,Pre-schools facilities will suspend large-group and communal activities, while eldercare facilities will also suspend external excursions and large gatherings.,Should community spread occur, more measures to reduce human interaction will be considered, authorities added.,""We are closely monitoring the situation and stand ready to ramp up our measures if necessary,"" said Mr Gan. ""I urge Singaporeans to remain calm. We will spare no effort to protect our people."", all had recent travel history to Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.,In an update, MOH said one of the cases was discharged on Tuesday after testing negative for the virus. The patient discharged, a 35-year-old man from Wuhan who, was the ,.,Many of the remaining cases ,; several need oxygen support but none are critically ill.,Chief Health Scientist Tan Chorh Chuan said that many of the patients are on supportive treatment while a small number are on an antiretroviral combination of Lopinavir and Ritonavir.,As of noon on Tuesday, 289 suspect cases have tested negative for 2019 novel coronavirus and test results for 20 cases are pending.,As a precaution, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient.

Man who defecated in court gets jail and caning for raping two 14-year-old girls,"SINGAPORE: A man who made headlines for malingering and defecating in his pants in court was found guilty of rape and sexual assault and sentenced to 32 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane on Wednesday (Feb 5).,Isham Kayubi, who turns 50 in June, was convicted of four charges of rape and two charges of sexual assault against two 14-year-old girls.,He had lured the two girls on separate occasions to his house on false pretences, raping them, forcing them to fellate him and filming the process.,Isham had urinated during a previous hearing in August 2019 and flashed his penis in court.,However, he was found to be mentally sound and fit to plead, and a report by the Institute of Mental Health said he was malingering.,When the trial began last month, he did not enter a plea, instead mumbling incoherently, said Justice See Kee Oon.,The hearing was delayed after Isham defecated in his pants on the way to the toilet and smeared it on his shirt. He also smeared it on a glass panel separating him from the court interpreter when he was taken back to court.,""I shall not go into details of his behaviour both in and out of the courtroom on that day,"" said Justice See.,However, he noted that the accused had twice been certified fit to plead and of sound mind, first when he was arrested and in an IMH report in September 2019.,As the trial progressed, Isham became more communicative and cross-examined some witnesses on the third day of the trial.,However, when called to enter his defence, he gave no response and instead repeatedly maintained that he needed time to get a lawyer.,""I had earlier rejected a similar request, bearing in mind that he was previously represented by Criminal Legal Aid Scheme lawyers who discharged themselves in November 2018 with his consent,"" said Justice See.,Isham had also been informed by CLAS that he would not be assigned another lawyer, the judge said, adding that Isham had ""ample time"" to engage counsel before the trial began in January 2020.,He found the victims to be candid and straightforward in their testimonies, and found that the prosecution had proven the charges. ,""The victims' evidence was that they were induced by the accused to go to his flat,"" said Justice See. ""He even threatened to have gang members come over to remove their clothes or gang-bang them if they refused to give in to his demands."",Isham threatened to make videos of the victims go viral, and they complied with his instructions out of fear.,In his defence, Isham had claimed that the victims had ""conspired"" against him to set him up, saying that they were both lying.,However, the judge rejected this, saying he saw no reason for them to fabricate or embellish their evidence, or to falsely implicate Isham.,He also assessed evidence including closed-circuit television footage, as well as video recordings and messages from Isham. ,Isham did not testify on the stand, and did not call any witnesses for his case.,Deputy Public Prosecutors James Chew and Jane Lim called for at least 30 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane.,Mr Chew listed Isham's string of previous convictions. He had been in and out of jail since 1995 for offences like theft and drugs.,In 2008, he was convicted of offences against four girls aged between 14 and 19. This included charges of carnal intercourse against the order of nature and carnal connections with a minor.,He used similar modus operandi in these offences, said Mr Chew, committing sexual offences against young girls and using his phone to capture the acts.,""We can see that he had actually tried to reach out to young girls randomly and then, using various pretexts, tried to bring them to location where he can commit sexual acts against them,"" said Mr Chew.,Shortly after his release from jail for the 2008 convictions, Isham was again jailed for drug consumption in 2011 and released around the end of 2015.,He committed the current rape and sexual assault offences about two years after his release.,Mr Chew said the sentencing must deter Isham and that the public, especially young girls, must be protected.,There are ""clear parallels"" to his previous offences, and Isham's proclivity to targeting young girls must be strongly considered, he added.,The latest victims were young and vulnerable, not just in terms of age but also because they had both run away from home when Isham targeted them and did not have family support.,When questioned by the judge on whether he considered Isham's conduct in court as an aggravating factor, Mr Chew said: ""We do recognise that there is a high likelihood that there will be separate action taken for that conduct."",He said the prosecution was not labelling the conduct an aggravating factor, but instead using it as part of the reason for saying Isham had shown a ""complete lack of remorse"".,Even after conviction, Isham maintained through the interpreter that he was not guilty. ,He asked for leniency in sentencing, saying he had been separated from his aged father after being incarcerated.,Justice See said he was generally in agreement with the prosecution, noting that Isham was not a first offender, and that there were previous related offences with parallels to the current case.,""There are clearly aggravating factors that are present in this case,"" he said. ""I do not see any relevant mitigating factors."",He backdated the sentence to November 2017, when Isham was remanded.,He could have been jailed for up to 20 years and fined or caned for each charge of rape.",<200 https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-who-defecated-in-court-gets-jail-and-caning-for-raping-two-12396360>
